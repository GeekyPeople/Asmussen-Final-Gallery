      <h4>My Name</h4>
      <p>Hello there! My name is Caitlyn, I’m an artist, writer, and game designer. I recently have
been getting my hands dirty getting to work on learning what really goes into game design,
including coding and design. I am a dungeon master and a regular player for dungeons and
dragons. While I can code, my interests lie in story writing, character creation, and design. I
have made subclasses, feats and monsters for my campaign. I approach design starting from a
narrative standpoint, a scene or a moveset, then build around that idea, making changes as
needed.
